<b>Changelog</b>

<b>2.1.0b71</b>
<b><font color='#009900'>Added experimental modded multiplayer</font></b>. Players with same mods are now allowed to connect to each other via LAN or through Xbox. This feature is experimental, may contain bugs and could be unstable, but it is already tested and debugged to be playable. <i>Please notice, that all mods must be same (and same versions) to play with each other, otherwise it will kick you and may cause crash, while connecting</i>.

<b><font color='#990000'>All mods need to be rewritten and adapted for multiplayer by their developers</font></b>, mods, with multiplayer support will be marked in mod browser as <font color='#1B3BDB'>[Multiplayer]</font>. You can play in multiplayer with not adapted mods, but it will show warning and most likely will cause mod malfunction and maybe even crash.

You are now able to login into Xbox to play not only on same WiFi, but via Xbox friends from any place. <i>If you have encountered some problems with logging in or playing online, you can always open FAQ in login dialog</i>.

<b>2.0.5b43</b>
- Optimized mod UI, making it a bit faster and consume less RAM
- Added new mode for standard window, making all contents appear in separate window instead of background one. To use it in a new mode, use UI.StandardWindow instead of misspelled UI.StandartWindow

- Resource and behavior packs are now injected inside each world upon enter
- Added TagRegistry module. Docs will be available after some tests and maybe rework.
- Callback.addCallback now has third optional parameter - priority (integer, default value is 0). Callbacks with higher priority will be called earlier

<b>2.0.3b30 beta</b>
<u>Main changes:</u>
